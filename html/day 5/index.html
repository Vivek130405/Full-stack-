                <p>Techniques for creating and manipulating multimedia information have progressed to the point
                    where they can now ensure a high degree of realism. DeepFake is a generative deep learning algorithm that
                    creates or modifies face features in a superrealistic form, in which it is difficult to distinguish between
                    real and fake features. This technology has greatly advanced and promotes a wide range of applications in
                    TV channels, video game industries, and cinema, such as improving visual effects in movies, as well as a
                    variety of criminal activities, such as misinformation generation by mimicking famous people</p>

                <p>Fake document detection is not a new issue. Rather, this issue
                    has existed for quite some time. In the past, the process of
                    legitimizing documents was confined to proofing, verification, and inquiry, and digital data had no significant role
                    in this process. T</p>
